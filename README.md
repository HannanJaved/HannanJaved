## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a PhD at the ELLIS Institute Tübingen, where I focus on research in artificial intelligence — especially Large Language Models (LLMs), deep learning, and model compression. My work is hands-on and experimental. I also enjoy mentoring students and sharing knowledge with the community.

## Skills

- Deep Learning, including Generative Models like GANs, VAEs, etc.
- LLMs: Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT), Evaluation, Synthetic Data Generation, Pretraining
- Model Compression & Knowledge Distillation
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- Teaching & Mentoring
